# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: Everyone knows what a tooth brush is and what it is used for. Everyone knows what it looks like and how to use it.

* Behavioral: The structure of the toothbrush is simple with easy use. The handle fits almsot all hands, and the brush- head fits into most people's mouths.

* Reflective:The toothbrush to me is a sign of cleaniness. I always feel a bit cleaner in the morning and at night after using it to bush my teeth.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1.Simplicity 
2.Helpfulness
3.Smooth Navigation
