# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Filename:Gaming.png & gaming2.png

Explanation of your color choices:I chose these colors because to me when I think of high-end, custom-made camping laptops, I can imagine green neon lights and to compliment the neon color black to grey makes it stand out.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Filename:organic.png & organic2.png

Explanation of your color choices:I chose to use shades of green and white because green shades give the user the mind set that the food is fresh and white can be associated with purity, as in the purity of the organic food that is being sold.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename:baking.png, baking2.png & baking3.png

Explanation of your color choices:I chose to go with a orange, white, and blue combination to really bring out the popping colors of orange with some blue hints and white so it doesnt strain the user's eyes. 

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename:kid.png, kid2.png, kid3.png, & kid4.png

Explanation of your color choices:I chose red, blue, yellow, and white for this website because this website is supposed to be a colorful to attract the kids attention and some white to balance all those colors out.
